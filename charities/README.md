	<td>This dataset cannot be considered as exhaustive. It contains currently registered main charities only, (i.e. not any linked charities which share the same charity registration number), and only those who state &quot;Trafford&quot; within their areas of operation. Charities stating their area of operation as &quot;Throughout England and Wales&quot;, whilst potentially including Trafford, have been omitted.</td>
