	<td>Dataset description</td>
	<td>Conservation Areas in England as designated by Local Planning Authorities and compiled by Historic England. Conservation areas exist to manage and protect the special architectural and historic interest of a place - in other words, the features that make it unique. Every local authority in England has at least one conservation area and there are around 10,000 in England. Most conservation areas are designated by the Council as the local planning authority. In conservation areas there are some extra planning controls and considerations in place to protect the historic and architectural elements which make the place special.</td>
