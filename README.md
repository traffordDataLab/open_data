# Open data
Information about Trafford published by external sources which the Trafford Data Lab clean, tidy and turn into [3 star open data](http://5stardata.info/en/#by-example) provided in [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) and [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) formats (as appropriate). Metadata for each dataset is available on the README of each data folder.

Please read the [guidance]((guidance/README.md)) on publishing open data in this repository.

Datasets that [Trafford Council](https://www.trafford.gov.uk) create and publish, i.e. the council is the source as well as the publisher of the data can be found within our [council_open_data repository](https://github.com/traffordDataLab/council_open_data).

We also have a dedicated [spatial_data repository](https://github.com/traffordDataLab/spatial_data) for statistical and administrative geographies, postcodes and geographical look-ups.
